# Sumobot

Sumobot is an open source sumobot design made for [BlueFletch Halloween Hack](http://bluefletch.com). Most existing sumo kits cost between $99 and $160. Since we're trying to keep our event costs down, I decided to try to design a bot that could be put together for around $50 including the cost of the Arduino.

Each bot also requires 4 AA batteries, and you will need at least 2 long [usb cables](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BCWALHM/ref=twister_B00CES8HYM?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1) for battles.
